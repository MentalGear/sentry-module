If you would like to modify a report's captured data before transmission (e.g. add additional or scrub sensitive data), you can use a [Sentry hook](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#hooks) within your 'config'.

Example of using a hook to trigger [Sentry's native User Feedback/Error Reporting Dialog](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/vue/enriching-events/user-feedback/) to gather additional information from the user:
```
    config: {
      environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
      beforeSend(event, hint) {
        // Check if it is an exception, and if so, show the report dialog
        if (event.exception) {
          // Native Sentry JS Bug/Feedback Reporter
          // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/vue/enriching-events/user-feedback/
          Sentry.showReportDialog({ eventId: event.event_id })
        }
        return event
      },
    },
```
